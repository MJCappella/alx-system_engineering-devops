# Web infrastructure design

This directory contains 4 files containing links to several images. These images describe several web infrastructure designs like:
<ul>
  <li>Simple web stack with a single server.</li>
  <li>Distributed web infrastructure containing 2 servers and a load balancer.</li>
  <li>Secured and monitored web infrastructure containing firewalls, SSL certificates and monitoring clients.</li>
  <li>Scale up design with split components with their own servers.</li>
</ul>

In addition to the images, explanations are given to the workings of each design right below the image links.
